# Rock_Paper_Scissors
A simple console game "Rock Paper Scissors"

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create an interactive console game "Rock Paper Scissors" aggainst a computer.

## Solution
The random module is used to generate the computer’s move. 
The validation of the player’s move, the outcome of the game (win, loss, or draw), and other messages are handled using if-elif-else statements inside a while loop. 
The loop runs until the player chooses to quit, allowing the user to play as many times as they want.
